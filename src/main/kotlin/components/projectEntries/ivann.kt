            |it looks to abstract away the coding aspect of coming up with a neural network model so
            |the scientist can focus on the design. In order to achieve this, the network is represented as a 
            |graph where the layers (or simply components) of the model are nodes which can be connected.
            |
            |This graph can then be used to perform static analysis to catch mistakes and provide
            |early feedback to the user (much like an IDE would!).

        +"""|In order to cater to all niches, Ivann supports _custom nodes_, which means the user can make
            |a node out of inline python. This allows using the UI to quickly access the most common bits
            |of the network, while being able to fine-tune other parts of the graph.

            |We developed Ivann as a team of 7. My focus was on the logic concerned with the IR, the static
            |analysis, and making code generation of Python code with Javascript objects a type-safe development
            |experience. In a way, Ivann reminded me a lot of engineering the compiler for WACC.
            |
            |Even then, Ivann was my first purely frontend project, and I got to learn about how difficult it is,
            |and how its challenges are very different from the ones I encounter when doing backend development.
